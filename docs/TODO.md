## Important

<!-- Tasks in this section are all completed! -->
- [ ] Bruh I forgot, i should implement this thing:
    - max font size should actually be the max font size, not going up that limit
    - min font size should actually be the min font size, not going down that limit

## Permanent

- [ ] Unit testing for mission critical piece of code

## Temporary

- [ ] Font loader thru fc-cache and whatnot
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] `imagesmacker.models` Models strict validation thru pydantic 
- [ ] Use [typeguard](https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide.html) to type check function arguments and return values in runtime
- [ ] Migrate from `poetry` to `uv`
- [ ] Add test coverage in README
- [ ] Replace `pyyaml` library dependency with `ruamel.yaml`

## Done

- [ ] remove `docs/.obsidian`

## Ideas

### Squish Text

squish down text horizontally when the text is too long

squish factor parameter, like how much u squeeze the text before u decrement the font size down

and a minimum font size parameter, like how much you can decrement before the drawer just give up

idkkkk

### Text Styles 

Italics, bold, that kinda stuff

### Angled Text

Not only text that are written vertically, but also text that are written at an angle.
